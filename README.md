# Arte Downloader V2

> This is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/JannikArndt/arte-downloader), which currently uses the v1 api from arte, they recently switched to a new version that uses HLS Streams, which prompted me to make a few changes to the script.


Since movies on Arte.tv are only available online for a _limited_ amount of time, you might want to download something to watch later. Please remember to buy the original copies, for the artists and production.

# How-To

1. Install [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), an extended `youtube-dl` variant, using your preffered package manager.

2. Run the script from Terminal:

```bash
./arte_downloader.sh
```

Paste the url of the video, select a quality, that's it.

# Dependencies

This script uses `curl`, `jq`, `sed` and `yt-dlp`.
